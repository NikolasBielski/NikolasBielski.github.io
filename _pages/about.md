 Kia ora! I'm Nikolas Bielski, and welcome to my personal website. Here you'll find things I've learned that I
 think others might find useful or interesting.\n
 During the day I work as analyst at the New Zealand Defence Force. In my own time I'm a part-time Ph.D student at the
 University of Canterbury researching geometric deep learning. I am passionate about how data analysis
 can enable decisions that lead to profound uplifts in the performance of delivering complex investment and strategic plans.\n
 I'm also open to contract work, so feel free to flick me an email discuss.
